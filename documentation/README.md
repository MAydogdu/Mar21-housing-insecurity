Sustainable education plays a pivotal role in early child development. One of the key indicator is stable housing environment. Research has shown that families with unstable living conditions play a major role in lower school participations.

This analysis addresses the question, "For New York City counties, which school districts see the highest rates of eviction?".

In this study the dependent variable is enrolled school-children. Where, school children are defined as children aged between 5 till 18. Further, I think independent variables such as the following can be useful; 
- family-size ()
- income (overall family income, principal earning member)
- mortgage (with or without it)
- state supported families
- families living below poverty line
- house type
	- own
	- rented

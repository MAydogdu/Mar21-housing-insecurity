# Introduction
Housing insecurity is a looming crisis in the U.S. Nearly 5 million Americans lose their homes through eviction and foreclosure. Volunteers will derive insights, create visualizations, and recommend action for two U.S. localities, including NYC.

# Key Questions for the DataDive Event
1. What is the overall trend of housing loss in these counties over the three-year period? Can any seasonality in housing loss be detected?
2. Which parts of these counties are experiencing the most acute housing loss? For which areas are evictions more prevalent per capita than foreclosures, and vice versa? 
3. For New York City counties, which school districts see the highest rates of eviction?
4. What are some of the key socio-demographic and economic characteristics of individuals who lose their homes to eviction and mortgage foreclosure? Which variables are most closely associated with housing loss, and which are less relevant? Is this different for Hillsborough County compared to New York City? 
5. When during the year are people experiencing evictions? Does this differ by location (NYC and Hillsborough)? 
6. Research Opportunity: Besides the American Community Survey, what other public datasets can you find that contain information potentially relevant to housing loss in these areas (e.g., unemployment, prevalence of residents receiving assistance such as SNAP)? Create a document summarizing their contents and where they can be found.
7. Research Opportunity: What qualitative information, or local context, can be added to this data? What questions arise from looking at the quantitative data or working with the data sources? For instance, how does the eviction process differ in New York City and Hillsborough County? Can you identify any major events from the past few years (prior to 2020) that may have impacted peopleâ€™s ability to remain housed?
